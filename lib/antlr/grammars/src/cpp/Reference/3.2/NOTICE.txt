INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

 This is a derived work. Please find the complete original
  work in the included zip file "CPP_parser_v_3.2.zip".
  This is an initial public release that needs more work
  to be complete. The major goal was to enable this parser
  to compile with ANTLR 3.2. Known issues include this
  may not compile with ANTLRWorks and must only be compiled
  through the command line suing the "compile.bat" script
  which is included in the package.


VERSION NOTICE:

 -- 2010 --
 Version 4.0.1 August 2010
 Modified and reworked to compile with ANTLR 3.2
  by Ramin Zaghi

 Please note that this is the first public release
  for ANTLR 3.2; This does not comiple with any older
  versions of ANTLR. This may also have some missing 
  features compared to the 2007 update by David Wigg.
  I am publishing this work only to make this first
  ANTLR 3.2 update  available  to  the  community
  however if you are interested in a more complete 
  work please take a look at David's 2007 update.
 
  I emphasize that this new update needs more work
  and can be restructured to make it more developer
  friendly. The project file is a MSVS2008 project
  file and it only includes a "Debug" configuration.
