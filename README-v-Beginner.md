# A Beginner's Guide for SSID Installation

**Guide in One Sentence**: A sister guide to the [official guide](https://github.com/WING-NUS/SSID/blob/master/README.md) with details on critical steps.

**Guide in One Paragraph**: Yisong has limited knowledge of Linux. He is only fluent with `bash`,  `tmux`, and `conda`. He has spent >6 hours trying to install SSID on his local machine (with external help with Riyas). This guide wishes to save your time by telling you the trick in critical steps.

## Package Installation

Make sure to install all packages in the version as exactly specified in the guide:

> 1. Ensure you have Java `11` (revision `11` or later) installed in your Computer.
> 2. Ensure that you have installed Ruby (v2.6.6) and [bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler/versions/2.1.4) (v2.1.4)
> 3. Since the application uses MySQL as its database server, please ensure that you have installed MySQL 8.0.



Yisong's config: a standard Ubuntu 18.04 version Linux.



### Java 11

No difficulty installing `Java 11`. 

I follow the guide from DigitalOcean, it works smoothly:

```

```



### Ruby v2.6.6. ; bundler v2.1.4

I had a hard time installing `Ruby v2.6.6`., which is the state-of-the-art version when I tried to install. 

I forgot my specific steps, but these tips are useful:

```

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#apt
```

TODO Yisong: replicate my own installation and update on this. 



I also had a hard time installing `bundler v2.1.4` since it is also the latest version. 

If my memory is correct, my successful installation follows these steps:

```
https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler/versions/2.1.4
```

Make sure to follow these commands:

```
gem 'bundler', '~> 2.1', '>= 2.1.4'
gem install bundler -v 2.1.4
```



### MySQL 8.0

The last package does not consume the least time. After a few trials, I successfully installed following this tutorial. 

```

```

Step 2 in this tutorial is very critical and new to new Linux users. 



ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully installed all packages!



## MySQL Config

After Yisong has successfully installed all these packages, he still failed to enter the development mode using these commands:

```
 rake db:create db:schema:dump db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
 rake db:seed
```



Why? After the help from Riyas, we find that the password of the `root` user of MySQL is not consistent with what we key in the SSID config file. 

Please `mysql -u root -p` to try to login into `root` to see if the password is correct. 



ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ All done!



## Final Words

If you have a problem installing, don't hesitate to ask Yisong or Riyas. One response of ours might save you several hours!
